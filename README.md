# Disease Prediction Webpage
adil-shafi.github.io

This project is a web-based disease prediction tool that uses Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm to predict the likelihood of different diseases based on the user's inputs. There are various prediction models, with the Multiple Disease Predictor (MDP) as the most advanced tool that can predict four diseases simultaneously. The MDP is the final iteration of the project that implements all of the experimentation and development processes from the other predictors to create a smooth and highly advanced version. The MDP would be a great place to start testing the functionality of the work that has been developed.
